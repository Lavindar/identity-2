Enable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active/Deactive Identity2

    
Fun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable/Disable Fun mode in special days
    
Format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base for witch the Identity will be generated on the chat. The tokens you can use are:
 - %s -> Will be replaced by the appropriate identity
 - %z -> Will be replaced by the name of the current zone
 - %l -> Will be replaced by the character level
 - %g -> Will be replaced by the character guild
 - %r -> Will be replaced by the realm name.
 - %f -> Will be replaced by the character faction

Any other character will be kept unchanged, for example the format:

[%s-%r]<%g>(%l) - %z

will look like this:
